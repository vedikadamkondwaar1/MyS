Today teachers employ storytelling in their classrooms by following 
guidelines brought forth by storytellers who conduct workshops for 
just this purpose. A storytelling community has emerged including 
both performers and educators who collectively have encouraged the 
art of storytelling. Even so, there are still many teachers and 
schools that do not recognize the value of storytelling and its 
use within the classroom. There are four reasons for this. First, 
teachers do not have a conscious awareness that they already tell stories
 within their classroom. Second, there are teachers.
